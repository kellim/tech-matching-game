# Tech Matching Game

This app is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and was added after I completed the Nanodegree and I went ahead and completed it. The game uses starter code from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

## How to play

Flip over two cards to see if they match. If they do, they'll stay flipped over, and if not they'll be turned back over. Continue to take turns flipping over two cards until you've matched all the cards.

## Contributions

As this is a Udacity project, no contributions will be accepted, but you can create your own similar game using the starter code in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.

## License

Since this includes Udacity starter code that does not have a license, I have not included an open source license like I normally would.
